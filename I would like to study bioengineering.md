# I Want to Study Engineering. But Now What?

## My Experience at Politecnico di Milano

I studied engineering at Politecnico di Milano and I am highly satisfied about the choice. I found fantastic professors in my path and I think I am now the person that I am thanks to them. There was a fantastic relationship with almost all of them, and I learnt the subject a lot too of course.

If I would have come back with the interest of studying biomedical engineering, I would have to take into account multiple scenarios that I wasn't aware about before.

## Why Study Biomedical Engineering?

Let me share a story that illustrates the unique value of biomedical engineering:

> My sister is a doctor. In her daily life, she would help an average of 10 patients every day. She wakes up every day, and she helps 10 patients. However, if she gets sick, she would help 0 patients.
>
> The difference between a doctor and an engineer is in the methodology. Both want to help patients, but an engineer builds products that can last, and people can use them with or without him. That's incredibly important as is the main difference with them. An engineer can scale the work by helping millions of patients, as well as having a product that can function independently.

## Universities to Consider

### Politecnico di Milano
- **Highlight**: Torrescalla or Viscontea as University residence (if you are Catholic)
- This was my path, and I had a fantastic experience at Torrescalla
- Strong engineering foundation with excellent facilities

### Humanitas University | MEDTECH Program
- More suitable if you want to be a doctor while getting clear engineering training
- Unique combination of medical and technical education
- Focused specifically on healthcare technology

### Sant'Anna University
- Excellent for either Medicine or Engineering
- Notable for the valuable network you develop
- Students are brilliant and can help you develop new skills
- Institution focuses on continuous improvement and learning

### EPFL - Life Science Engineering
- Significant opportunity for those with French language skills
- High-quality engineering education with international recognition
- I studied French at high school and could have pursued this path
- Unfortunately, I wasn't aware of this opportunity at the time

## Other Merit Schools Worth Considering

There are several merit institutions throughout Italy where you can find smart people and excellent professors. These can be great environments for personal growth and learning.

### Notable Options:
- **Pavia**: Ghisleri or Borromeo colleges
- **Rome**: Various merit institutions
- **Udine**: Superiore dell'Universit√† di Udine

## Personal Note

Most of what I have done was self-defined. While it may seem somewhat conventional now, it wasn't 5 years ago. I had to develop this path as one of the first people, at least from my perspective. This uniqueness has contributed significantly to my professional development.
