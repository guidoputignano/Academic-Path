# I Want to Study Engineering. But Now What?

## My Experience at Politecnico di Milano

I studied engineering at Politecnico di Milano and I am highly satisfied with this choice. Throughout my journey, I encountered fantastic professors who have shaped me into the person I am today. I developed excellent relationships with almost all of them, and of course, I learned a great deal about my subject matter as well.

If I were to start over with an interest in studying biomedical engineering, I would need to consider multiple scenarios that I wasn't aware of before.

## Why Study Biomedical Engineering?

Let me share a story that illustrates the unique value of biomedical engineering:

> My sister is a doctor. In her practice, she helps an average of 10 patients daily. She goes to work each day and provides care to these 10 patients. However, if she falls ill, she helps zero patients.
>
> The fundamental difference between a doctor and an engineer lies in their methodology. Both want to help patients, but an engineer builds products that endure and can be used with or without the engineer's presence. This scalability is crucial—it's the main distinction between the professions. An engineer can scale their impact by helping millions of patients through products that function independently.

## Universities to Consider

### Politecnico di Milano
- **Highlight**: Torrescalla or Viscontea as university residences (if you are Catholic)
- This was my path, and I had a fantastic experience at Torrescalla
- Strong engineering foundation with excellent facilities

### Humanitas University | MEDTECH Program
- More suitable if you want to be a doctor while receiving solid engineering training
- Unique combination of medical and technical education
- Focused specifically on healthcare technology

### Sant'Anna University
- Excellent for either Medicine or Engineering
- Notable for the valuable network you develop
- Students are brilliant and can help you cultivate new skills
- Institution emphasizes continuous improvement and learning

### EPFL - Life Science Engineering
- Significant opportunity for those with French language skills
- High-quality engineering education with international recognition
- I studied French in high school and could have pursued this path
- Unfortunately, I wasn't aware of this opportunity at the time

## Other Merit Schools Worth Considering

There are several merit-based institutions throughout Italy where you can find bright minds and excellent professors. These can be great environments for personal growth and learning.

### Notable Options:
- **Pavia**: Ghisleri or Borromeo colleges
- **Rome**: Various merit institutions
- **Udine**: Superiore dell'Università di Udine

## Personal Note

Much of what I've accomplished was self-directed. While my path may seem somewhat conventional now, it wasn't five years ago. I had to pioneer this journey as one of the first to do so, at least from my perspective. This uniqueness has contributed significantly to my professional development.
